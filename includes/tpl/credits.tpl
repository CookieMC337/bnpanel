<strong>So who made this wonderful script?</strong><br />
TheHostingTool was originally developed and maintained by Jonny H, who wrote the wonderful core we all know and love. After 1.1.2 was released, control over the project was transfered to Nick D and Jimmie Lin, who then invited Kevin M to their team.
<br /><br /><strong>Here is our Current Development Team:</strong>

The Hosting Tool is a free, powerful script released under the GNU-GPL license. A lot of hours (understatement) were spent making this script. Have some dignity and leave the credits in. If not, support won't be given and we won't like you. Bad times, Bad times.<br /><br />
